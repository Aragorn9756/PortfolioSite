  <tr>
	<td colspan="2">The Harry Potter books and movies were my childhood. I read the books 
	  with my family growing up and we all watched the movies together. I love 
	  the movies and I love the books. Something about the story really 
	  harmonizes with me and the characters are all so relatable. Harry Potter 
	  and the Sorcerer's Stone is the movie that I remember most fondly and most 
	  closely fit what I imagined Hogwarts to be like.</td>
	
	<td colspan="2">The Lord of the Rings movies were excellent interpretations of one of 
	  the bastions of the fantasy Genre. I had read the books in elementary 
	  school, but these movies are what really brought them to life for me. The 
	  reason I chose the fellowship is because of the two characters unique to 
	  it: Sauron in full battle armor, and the Balrog. Who doesn't look at 
	  those and just think "COOL!"?</td>
	
	<td colspan="2">The Prestige is one of those movies that you have to watch at least 
	  twice to really get a handle on the story. Hugh Jackman and Christian 
	  Bale act brilliantly keeping you hooked from the first scene. Then There 
	  was the twist! I love movies that make you think and keep you guessing.</td>

	  Castle in the Sky</a></h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td colspan="3">The Dark Knight was an emotional roller-coster for me. There were 
	  adrenaline highs and emotional punches in the gut. But Heath Ledger's 
	  take on the Joker is and forever will be legendary. He portrays the Joker 
	  as a criminal and social genius that always keeps you guessing. Every 
	  twist and turn makes you think about how society thinks and reacts, and 
	  begs the question, "What would I do?".</td>

	<td colspan="3">Hayao Miyazaki is a master storyteller, and while I believe that 
	  Spirited Away is his real masterpiece, Castle in the Sky is the one I 
	  love the most. The fantastical setting and the lovable characters really 
	  do it for me. The story is predictable without being boring, but Miyazaki 
	  has a way of just bringing the screen to life, and his art style is 
	  gorgeous.</td>
