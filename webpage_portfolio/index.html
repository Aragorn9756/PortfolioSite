	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	<p>This site is how I will show what I have learned 
	and the progress I have made, and boy am I excited to show my stuff! 
	Although the subject matter for each page is set, I am a geek at heart and 
	will have all sorts of geeky references throughout my site. For example, 
	the color pallet for the site was inspired by FromSoftware's Dark Souls 
	series, and did you notice the icon on the tab of your browser? I hope you 
	enjoy the personality I've tried to breath into this site and may the odds 
	be ever in your favor.</p>

    <h2><a href="my_hobbies.html">My Hobbies</a></h2>
	<p>This page describes of of my favorite free time activities. I sometimes 
	think that it is what we do in our free time that really fleshes us out as 
	a person. If you go to this page, you'll find out that I am just one huge 
	geek, if you didn't know that already.</p>

    <h2><a href="fav_movies.html">My Favorite Movies</a></h2>
	<p>On this page I describe why my favorite movies have earned their place 
	heart. I had a really hard time trimming down my list to just five examples. 
	I could go for days about movies that I love, and even longer if we changed 
	the topic to video games.</p>

    <h2><a href="bloodborne_mad_lib/bloodborne_mad_lib.html">The Hunt Begins Mad Lib</a></h2>
	<p>I enjoyed putting this page together! We learned the basics of collecting 
		information from users to use on the our webpage via javascript and were 
		subsequently asked to make a mad lib using our recently acquired skills. 
		I decided to center my story around the opening of FromSoftware's atmospheric 
		game, Bloodborne.</p>

    <h2><a href="animation_page/animation_page.html">Geeky Animations</a></h2>
	<p>This was the last page we made this semester and, as the title suggests, 
		it has animations! This was a show case of some simple types of animations, so
		I chose a couple more fandoms that I liked and made animations based on that. 
		I have a wiggling pokeball, classic 8-bit Mario shrinking and growing like he's 
		just had a red mushroom, and the Golden Snitch flying around the page. There's 
		also 1 more animation you'll just have to go to the page to find!</p>

    <h2><a href="youth_shelter_home\index.html">Youth Shelter Home Page</a></h2>
	<p>This page was a midterm project for my Web developement class. We were 
	  given the design specifications and told to code up a page so that the 
	  end product looked exactly like the design we were given. Since I have a 
	  hard time with designing anything, I found this project quite easy, and 
	  actually very of fun.</p>

    <h2><a href="pet_comp_form/pet_comp_form.html">Pet Competition</a></h2>
	<p>For this page, I've created an application form for a non-existent pet 
		competition. The purpose behind this page was to exhibit my understanding of 
		how to collect information from users via a form. I decided to make a 
		separate css style sheet in order to fit the theme of the form better.</p>

    <h2><a href="evolution_of_Samus/metroid_slideshow.html">Samus Through the Years</a></h2>
	<p>This link will take you to a page with a slideshow illustrating how Samus Aran of 
		Nintendo's Metroid franchise has changed over the years. I also snuck in a little 
		trivia here and there, so make sure you go check it out. And if you've never even 
		heard of Metroid, don't worry! I made sure to add a short synopsis for you too.</p>

    <h2><a href="js_calc/calculator.html">JavaScript Calculator</a></h2>
	<p>This page is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It is a fairly simple, 
		yet functional calculator that runs via JavaScript. Not much else to it if 
		you don't get the behind-the-scenes aspect of programming it.</p>

    <h2>The End Goal</h2>
	<p>People are always curious as to what your plan is. "Oh, you're going to 
	school? What degree are you getting? What are you going to do with it?" 
	It's been a long convoluted journey for me, but I think I finally know what 
	I want to do with my time. I would like to help make quality video games. 
	Video games have always been a draw for me. They are, at their best, 
	interactive stories that draw you in like no other medium can. I have 
	always been awed at the work of my favorite developers. It has taken me a 
	while to decide that being a part of that creative process is a viable way 
	for me to provide for my family. It is how I can truly do what I love. And 
	I can't wait to get started!</p>
