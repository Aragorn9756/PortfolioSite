<p>Everyone enjoys doing different things in their free time. Personally, I 
enjoy engrossing myself in stories or creating something beautiful or 
memorable. Specifically, I enjoy:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Playing Video Games</li>
  <li>Reading</li>
  <li>Cross-Stitching</li>
  <li>Making Models</li>
</ul>

<h2>Video Games</h2>

<p>I really enjoy playing video games. Of course I appreciate them for the 
gameplay, but that's not all. The games that really stick with me are games 
that have been filled with complex, amazing stories and lovingly crafted to the 
finest of details. The Mass Effect series probably has some of the most 
engrossing and thought provoking storylines. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the 
Wild and The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim are filled to the brim with detailed 
environments and tasks to complete. But the games that most envelop what I love 
about gaming are the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne, created by FromSoftware. 
The story and interactions are so engrossing and thought provoking, and to get 
the entire story, you have to look at the details that they have implanted into 
the environment. It is the ultimate example of interactive storytelling! For 
anybody interested in getting a better idea of what these games are all about, 
or looking for some help and insight into them, <a href="http://www.wiki.fextralife.com/">
fextralife</a> has some wonderfully put together wikis to go through.</p>

<h2 class="clear_left">Reading</h2>

  alt="A scene from the mistborn series. Vin and Elend fighting Koloss and Inquisitors.">

<p>Another form of media that I really enjoy partaking in is reading, particularly 
fantasy novels. Some of my all time favorites include J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord 
of the Rings, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series And Garth Nix's Old Kingdom 
series. That being, anything well written I enjoy. I loved reading the biography 
on Abraham Lincoln, Team of Rivals by Doris Goodwin, and like reading about 
mythology and books based on mythology. However, my current interests lie in 
Brandon Sanderson's cosmere. Sanderson has constructed and entire universe, or 
cosmere as he calls it, of different worlds with there own magic system in each. 
So far the books, including Elantris, the Stormlight Archive, and the Mistborn 
series, have been seperate and distinct novels and series, but he is slowly 
bringing them together into one universal epic. I can't really do his grand 
scheme or his brilliant, New York Times bestselling books justice, so if this 
sounds interesting to you or you want to get a better idea of what I'm talking 
about, please visit his <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/">website</a>.</p>

<h2 class="clear_right">Cross-Stitching</h2>
<img class="left_floating" src="images/geisha_stitched_opt.jpg" width="349" height="450" 
 alt="A cross-stitched geisha.">

<p>Whenever I am doing something that requires my ears but not my hands, one of 
the things I like to do is counted cross-stitch. Counted cross-stitch is an 
image made on aida cloth, or cloth with small holes at regular intervals, using 
thread of various colors to make small X's and outline your X's based on a 
pattern. The end product will look something like the picture. Of course, you 
don't have to use a pattern, but I like to. I don't feel confident enough in my 
creative abilities, nor do I want to take the time to make my own patterns. I 
like doing this because it calms me and keeps my hands busy. I like to be doing 
something at all times, and this scratches that itch.</p>

<h2 class="clear_right">Metal Earth Models</h2>

<p>The other thing that I enjoy creating is models, but not just any models. 
These models, called Metal Earth Models, are made by taking stamped sheets of 
metal and, using the assembly instructions, putting them in place and bending 
tabs to make a small model. I first saw these at Comic Con in Salt Lake City 
and I've been slowly collecting them since. It's been wonderful because it 
requires very little skill and just a couple pairs of pliers. They have models 
from all sorts of franchises, including Star Wars, Marvel and Harry Potter as 
well as architecture, animals, instruments and much more. I would encourage you 
to take a look at what they have at their website by clicking on the picture of 
the completed model.</p>
