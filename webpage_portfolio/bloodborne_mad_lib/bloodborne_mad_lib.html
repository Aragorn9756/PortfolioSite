	<p>The Hunt Begins is a mad lib based off of FromSoftware's grim and atmospheric 
	  Bloodborne. While this small story was originally written to reflect it's 
		inspiration's dark and gritty tone, this is a mad lib! See what you can come 
		up with and remember, <span class="quote">seek the paleblood to transcend 
		the hunt.</span></p>
	
	<p class="quote">"Good, all signed and sealed.<br>Now, let's begin the transfusion. Oh,

			alt="'An unnaturally large wolf pulled itself from the liquid...'">
		
		<p id="p1"><span>Elizabeth</span> came to, head <span>pounding</span>. 
			<span>She</span> tried to shift but found that <span>she</span> was still 
			strapped to the <span>operating table</span>. <span>She</span> inspected 
			<span>her</span> surroundings. The room had <span>bloodstains</span> all 
			over. <span>Operating tables</span> were ordered neatly throughout the 
			room. Bottles of <span>blood</span> and who knows what else lined the 
			walls. <span>Elizabeth</span> swooned, nearly slipping back into 
			<span>unconciousness</span>. Just as <span>she</span> regained focus, 
			<span>she</span>	noticed something exceedingly <span>strange</span> in 
			the middle of the room; a pool of <span>dark red</span> liquid beginning 
			to radiate outwards, growing larger by the second. Then something began 
			to emerge from the pool... First a <span>paw</span> the size of 
			<span>Elizabeth</span>'s face, followed by a second <span>paw</span>, 
			then a large <span>lupine</span> head. An unnaturally <span>large</span> 
			<span>wolf</span> pulled itself from the liquid, soaked in a red 
			substance. <span>Blood</span>, <span>Elizabeth</span> realized. 
			<span>She</span> was going to die. Suddenly, the nightmarish beast burst 
			into <span>flames</span>, howling in agony as it disappeared back into 
			the <span>blood</span> from whence it came. The last thing 
			<span>Elizabeth</span> <span>remembered</span> before <span>her</span> 
			taxed mind gave out on <span>her</span> was a plethora of small 
			<span>skeletal</span> figures, no bigger than infants, 
			<span>creeping</span> from over the side of the table to cover 
			<span>her</span> protectively. Pure white, their gaunt faces were masks 
			of unspeakable pain and despair, yet paradoxically exuded such innocence 
			and curiosity, <span>Elizabeth</span> couldn't help but feel 
			<span>comforted</span> as <span>she</span> let go of conciousness.</p>
		
		<p id="p2">When <span>Elizabeth</span> awoke again, <span>She</span> was 
			completely <span>lost</span>. Picking <span>herself</span> up from off 
			the ground, <span>she</span> inspected her surroundings. <span>She</span> 
			seemed to be in some sort of <span>graveyard</span>. 
			<span>Gravestones</span> were everywhere <span>she</span> looked, with 
			small white flowers filling the spaces between. Leaning up against a bush, 
			next to a flight of steps was a life size female <span>doll</span>. The 
			<span>doll</span> had soft gray hair and a sweet, caring expression upon 
			her <span>face</span>.</p>
		
		<img src="../images/messengers_opt.jpg" width="229" height="131" 
			id="float_left" alt="'small skeletal figures, no bigger than infants'">
		
		<p id="p3">"A great deal of <span>love</span> and care has obviously gone 
			into this <span>doll</span>," <span>Elizabeth</span> thought. 
			<span>Walking</span> up the steps, <span>she</span> entered a small 
			<span>workshop</span>. On the far side was an altar of some sort. Along 
			the right wall was a large storage chest and a table with all sorts of 
			tools. On the left wall sat a <span>bookshelf</span> with tomes in various 
			languages and characters. Next to the <span>bookshelf</span> was a cozy 
			fireplace with an old man in a <span>wheelchair</span>, seeming to sleep. 
			With startling speed, the man looked up at <span>Elizabeth</span> with an 
			intelligent and <span>sorrowful</span> gaze.</p>
			
		<p id="p4">"Ah, you must be the one the messengers found," the man said. "I 
			am Gehrman, and you are our newest <span>hunter</span>! Welcome to the 
			<span>Hunter's</span> Dream. This place will serve as a respite during your 
			adventures out in Yharnam. Feel free to use anything you find here, though 
			many <span>items</span> have gone missing since the Hunt was at it's peak. 
			I think you will find the <span>doll</span> especially useful. Here is a 
			weapon, and a firearm to take with you. May they serve you well. Now, go 
			and <span>kill</span> some beasts. It's for your own good."</p>
			
		<p id="p5"><span>Elizabeth</span> took an <span>axe</span> and a 
			<span>pistol</span> from Gehrman. Although both weapons were well worn 
			from use, they were of high quality and still quite <span>deadly</span>. 
			<span>She</span> examined the one-handed hunting <span>axe</span>. The 
			handle was <span>ingeniously</span> designed to extend and turn the 
			<span>axe</span> into a two-handed <span>poleaxe</span> with incredible 
			reach. <span>Elizabeth</span> had no idea what <span>she</span> was getting 
			<span>herself</span> into, but <span>she</span> now felt incredibly well 
			<span>prepared</span> to face whatever monstrosities came <span>her</span> 
			way.</p>
